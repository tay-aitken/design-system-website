**_Welcome and thank you for contributing!_ The Carbon team is committed to maintaining consistent, quality guidelines. We welcome all feedback, designs, or ideas in order to produce the best possible experience for our users. Below are our contribution models and best practices.**


## Contribution models

Carbon has three different levels of contribution. Click on the contribution level name to read more details about the workflow process for that particular level of contribution.


- [Light](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-system-website/wiki/Contribution-(Light): A small design tweak (i.e. changing a boarder color)
- [Medium](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-system-website/wiki/Contribution-(Medium): Adding to/or changing guidelines, or contributing an icon
- [Heavy](): Contributing a whole new component to the system


### Submitting an issue
If you are not sure which model your contribution fits into, open an issue in one our repos and we will figure out which model it falls into.

**Not sure where to open an issue?**

* The [carbon-design-kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit) is for Sketch bugs, as well as feedback on the Design Kit.

* The [design-system-website repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-system-website) is for Carbon website specific feedback or bugs.

* The [carbon-components repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components) is for component specific feedback, bugs, design, or contributions.

**Not sure how to submit an issue?**

It's not so bad, we promise! You can read a [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on GitHub to get familiar with best practices.

## Before you start

Below are standards all Carbon assets need to meet before being brought into the system. To ensure a smooth contribution process make sure your contribution follows all of the guidelines below.

#### Accessible

* Is your design [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) accessible?
* Does your design pass [color contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) ratio?
* Have you considered [keyboard tabbing](/guidelines/accessibility) and focus states?


#### Visual style and UX patterns

* Is your design consistent with our default visual style we have established for the core Carbon library?
* Do your interaction patterns (hover, focus, motion) match Carbon styles?
* Does it use our color and spacing tokens, as well as type styles and scale?
* Does your design follow basic UX best practices?
* Does your design promote clear language, correct grammar, and support globalization?


#### Componentized

The components we accept into the global library need to work universally across products.

* Have you tested this design for multiple use cases? It needs to be a pattern that all teams can utilize, and global enough to fit use cases for other teams.
* Is there a similar component in the library that already exists?
* What are the advantages of this pattern over alternative patterns?

#### Production guidelines

Once your contribution has been approved by Carbon and you are making assets for the website, we recommend taking a look at our website [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-system-website/wiki/Production-guidelines) for imagery specifications.
